1) The code change for the mutation changes apply to the Anomaly_Correction experiment.

2) The original code had wrong casual variables for the SCM_PROGRAMMING SCM, we corrected that and ran the code for a confidence of 0.75 .

3) The main code change is in the following file :

  ..Extension_ICR\Anomaly_Correction\icr\src\mcr\causality\scms\examples.py

  The original dictionary storing the casual variables for the SCM_PROGRAMMING SCM was :

    fnc_dict={'senior-level_skill': fn_skilled, 'nr_commits': fn_nr_commits, 'nr_stars': fn_nr_stars, 'fever': fn_fever,'fatigue': fn_fatigue}

    we corrected it to :

    fnc_dict={'senior-level_skill': fn_skilled, 'nr_commits': fn_nr_commits, 'nr_stars': fn_nr_stars, 'nr_languages': fn_nr_languages}
   

4) To run the experiment you use the same command :

        sbatch 5_var_skill_corrected.job

5) The results would be available in the Synthetic_Dataset_Results folder.

6) We have not used plots here as the experiment is run only for a single confidence value.
